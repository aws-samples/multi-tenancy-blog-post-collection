How to securely segregate tenant data and how to provide data access to customers will vary depending on the SaaS solution’s architecture and its requirements. This post explores how SaaS vendors can build secure, scalable, and cost-effective data exchange mechanisms using SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) with AWS managed services like AWS Transfer Family. |

| AWS Transfer Family provides SFTP, FTPS, and/or FTP access to Amazon S3 or Amazon Amazon EFS. It does that by providing a secure, highly available, and scalable server endpoint. You pay for the time this endpoint is enabled, and for data transfer (upload and download). Learn how this makes a multi-tenant setup where an endpoint is shared between different users (or applications), a more cost-efficient solution than having dedicated endpoints. |
