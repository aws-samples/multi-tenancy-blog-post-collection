| This post describes how to automate the deployment process of a single-tenant SaaS solution to deliver software quickly, securely, and less error-prone for each existing tenant. To achieve a higher level of environment segregation across the tenants, I demonstrate all the steps to build and configure a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CloudFormation. For each new version, the pipeline automatically deploys the same application version on the multiple tenant AWS accounts. |
