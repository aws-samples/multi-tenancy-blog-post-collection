| The Cost Optimization Pillar of the SaaS Lens for the AWS Well-Architected Framework emphasizes the need for expenditure awareness by measuring tenant consumption and correlating it to tenant costs. This can prove challenging in SaaS solutions, where resources are shared across tenants. Learn how to leverage CloudZero to gain visibility into tenant consumption, and how you can gain insights into tenant cost using CloudZeroâ€™s Enhanced Unit Cost Analytics. |

| In a SaaS environment, the compute, storage, and bandwidth resources are often shared among tenants, but this makes it challenging to deduce per tenant cost. A SaaS application running on a Kubernetes cluster on AWS adds a layer of further complexity as far as calculating the per tenant cost. Kubernetes is great at abstracting away the underlying pool of hardware. It almost gives us an illusion of having access to a single large compute resource. |
