| Explore the hybrid-tenant architecture Sela designed and implemented for Dittofi’s hosting platform. We’ll focus on the underlying architecture of the Dittofi hosting platform where tenant workloads run, as well as the architecture for the hybrid-tenant control plane that enables the provisioning, de-provisioning, and updating of tenants. We’ll pay special attention to the user experience during the development of no-code applications and the measures Sela put in place to enable near-real-time code generation. |

| This post describes how to automate the deployment process of a single-tenant SaaS solution to deliver software quickly, securely, and less error-prone for each existing tenant. To achieve a higher level of environment segregation across the tenants, I demonstrate all the steps to build and configure a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CloudFormation. For each new version, the pipeline automatically deploys the same application version on the multiple tenant AWS accounts. |
